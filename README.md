# Amazon EKS AMI RHEL Build Specification

This repository contains resources and configuration scripts for building a
custom Amazon EKS AMI running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux with [HashiCorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/). This is
a forked version of the configuration that Amazon EKS uses to create the official Amazon EKS-optimized AMI.

**Check out the [üìñ documentation](https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-eks-ami-rhel/) to learn more.**

## üîî Announcements

### November 23, 2024 - Pause container image caching requires IAM credentials

Pause container image caching was [readded to the upstream build process](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/pull/2000). This requires a few configurations for the build to complete successfully:
* Proper configuration of the new ```pause_container_image``` parameter. You can find the AWS managed regional repository using the [documented list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-ons-images.html).
* IAM credentials with permissions to read from AWS managed ECR repositories.
  * These credentials can either be passed in via API keys or (recommended) you can attach an IAM Instance Profile during the build process by passing in the ```iam_instance_profile``` parameter.
  
Example commands with the ```pause_container_image``` and ```iam_instance_profile``` parameters configured can be found below.
 
### March 6, 2024 - This code base now follows the Amazon Linux 2023 custom EKS AMI code base

This code base has always followed the [awslabs amazon-eks-ami](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami) code base as closely as possible.
* Significant changes were made to that upstream code base to provide EKS support for Amazon Linux 2023.
* Because Amazon Linux 2 is now under extended support, this code base will now follow the Amazon Linux 2023 code base of the upstream repository.
* The [scripts for creating worker node groups](https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-eks-ami-rhel/nodegroups/) have been modified to account for how worker nodes join EKS clusters under the new process.
* The previous code base, which was based on Amazon Linux 2 build scripts, will remain available under the [al2-base branch](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-ami-rhel/tree/al2-base).

## üöÄ Getting started

If you are new to Amazon EKS, we recommend that you follow
our [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
chapter in the Amazon EKS User Guide. If you already have a cluster, and you
want to launch a node group with your new AMI, see [Launching Amazon EKS Worker
Nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html).

## üî¢ Pre-requisites

* RHEL image of your choosing.
* Internet connectivity from EC2 for file downloads OR files stored locally in S3 bucket.
* You must have [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) version 1.8.0 or later installed on your local system, an EC2 Instance in AWS, or in [AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/). For more information, see [Installing Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html) in the Packer documentation.
* You must also have AWS account credentials configured so that Packer can make calls to AWS API operations on your behalf. For more information, see [Authentication](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon.html#specifying-amazon-credentials) in the Packer documentation.
* We recommend using AWS CloudShell for simplicity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Packer in CloudShell
```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install packer
packer plugins install github.com/hashicorp/amazon

```

## üóÇÔ∏è Cloning the Github repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-ami-rhel.git && cd amazon-eks-ami-rhel

```

## üë∑ Building the AMI

A Makefile is provided to build the Amazon EKS Worker AMI, but it is just a small wrapper around
invoking Packer directly. You can initiate the build process by running the
following command in the root of this repository:

```bash
# Example for building an AMI with the latest Kubernetes version and the latest RHEL 8.9 AMI. This would use all variables stored in the variables-default.json file.
make

# Example for building an AMI with the latest Kubernetes version and the latest RHEL 8.9 AMI in us-gov-east-1
make k8s=1.30 ami_regions=us-gov-east-1 aws_region=us-gov-east-1 iam_instance_profile=EC2Role pause_container_image=151742754352.dkr.ecr.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com/eks/pause:3.5

# Example for building an AMI off of the latest RHEL 9.0.0 AMI in us-east-2 region
make k8s=1.30 source_ami_filter_name=RHEL-9.0.0_HVM-2023*-x86_64-* ami_regions=us-east-2 aws_region=us-east-2 iam_instance_profile=EC2Role pause_container_image=602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eks/pause:3.5

# Example for building a customized DISA STIG compliant AMI, owned by a specific AWS Account in AWS GovCloud us-gov-east-1 region, with binaries stored in a private S3 bucket, an IAM instance profile attached, a user data script to install the AWS Systems Manager agent, and using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for Packer terminal access.
make k8s=1.30 source_ami_owners=123456789123 source_ami_filter_name=RHEL9_STIG_BASE*2023-04-14* ami_regions=us-gov-east-1 aws_region=us-gov-east-1 binary_bucket_name=my-eks-bucket binary_bucket_region=us-gov-east-1 iam_instance_profile=EC2Role pause_container_image=151742754352.dkr.ecr.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com/eks/pause:3.5 pull_cni_from_github=false ssh_interface=session_manager user_data_file=/path/to/ssm_install.txt

# Check default value and options in help doc
make help
```

The Makefile chooses a particular kubelet binary to use per Kubernetes version which you can [view here](Makefile).

> **Note**
> There is a network routing issue caused by the nm-cloud-setup service that comes preinstalled on RHEL machines. In the AWS [Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/run-amazon-eks-on-rhel-worker-nodes-with-ipvs-networking), we demonstrate how to disable this service and reboot the EC2 instances as recommended by Red Hat in the following KB [article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6319811).

> **Note**
> The default instance type to build this AMI does not qualify for the AWS free tier.
> You are charged for any instances created when building this AMI.

> **Note**
> This has been tested on RHEL 8.6+ and RHEL 9+ images with 80+ DISA STIG SCAP scores.

# Worker node group creation scripts

This directory contains sample scripts for creating EKS worker node groups after worker node AMI creation. These scripts were written to help you get started, not for production implementation!

## üîî Announcements

### Worker nodes are now joined to EKS clusters using [nodeadm](nodeadm/README.md)

The new method of joining EKS clusters using [nodeadm](nodeadm/README.md) is significantly different than the deprecated bootstrap.sh script method. For this reason, some sample scripts have been provided here to get you started.

> **Note**
> These changes require functionality that is not curently available using [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/), so for now any scripts that reference eksctl are not working. A bug report has been submitted to address this issue.

## üë∑ Usage

Example commands to launch a new worker node group with a custom configuration:
```bash
# Long syntax
./create_nodegroup_cfn.sh --cluster-name rhel-eks-cluster --ami-id ami-0b2e96e12344a54c0 --managed-node-group rhel-eks-node-group --region us-gov-east-1 --instance-type t3.medium --min-size 3 --desired-size 3 --max-size 3 --subnets private

# Short syntax
./create_nodegroup_cfn.sh -c rhel-eks-cluster -a ami-0b2e96e12344a54c0 -m rhel-eks-node-group -r us-gov-east-1 -i t3.medium -n 3 -d 3 -x 3 -s private
```
This would create a node group with the following configuration:
```yaml
Cluster: rhel-eks-cluster
AMI ID: ami-0b2e96e12344a54c0
Node group name: rhel-eks-node-group
AWS Region: us-gov-east-1
Instance type: t3.medium
Minimum node group size: 3
Desired node group size: 3
Maximum node group size: 3
Subnet type: private
```

This command would generate a local CloudFormation template and execute the CloudFormation stack via the AWS CLI.

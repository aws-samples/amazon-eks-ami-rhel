# Worker node group creation scripts

This directory contains sample scripts for creating EKS worker node groups after worker node AMI creation. These scripts were written to help you get started, not for production implementation!

## üîî Announcements

### Worker nodes are now joined to EKS clusters using [nodeadm](nodeadm/README.md)

The new method of joining EKS clusters using [nodeadm](nodeadm/README.md) is significantly different than the deprecated bootstrap.sh script method. For this reason, some sample scripts have been provided here to get you started.

> **Note**
> These changes require functionality that is not curently available using [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/), so for now any scripts that reference eksctl are not working. A bug report has been submitted to address this issue.

## üë∑ Usage

Example command to launch a new worker node group with a custom configuration:
```bash
./create_nodegroup_cfn_zsh.sh rhel-eks ami-0b2e96e12344a54c0 rhel-eks-node-group us-gov-east-1 govcloud2024 t3.medium 3 3 3 https://5B3FFDCDC05F2D983E65079309123456.gr7.us-gov-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com 10.100.0.0/16 LS0tLS1CRUdLS0tLS0K "subnet-0f034415c5b771234 subnet-0bdba07340be11234 subnet-05c651fa62a571234" sg-038c07b2206e12345
```
This would create a node group with the following configuration:
```yaml
Cluster: rhel-eks
AMI ID: ami-0b2e96e12344a54c0
Node group name: rhel-eks-node-group
AWS Region: us-gov-east-1
Keypair name: govcloud2024
Instance type: t3.medium
Min node group size: 3
Desired node group size: 3
Max node group size: 3
EKS API endpoint: https://5B3FFDCDC05F2D983E65079309123456.gr7.us-gov-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com
CIDR range: 10.100.0.0/16
Certificate: LS0tLS1CRUdLS0tLS0K
Subnet IDs: subnet-0f034415c5b771234 subnet-0bdba07340be11234 subnet-05c651fa62a571234
Security group ID: sg-038c07b2206e12345
```

This command would generate a local CloudFormation template and execute the CloudFormation stack via the AWS CLI.
